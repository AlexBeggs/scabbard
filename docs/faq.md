# Frequently Asked Questions

Have a question that isn't part of the FAQ? Please search [Github Issues](https://github.com/arunkumar9t2/scabbard/issues).

## What is the impact on binary size?

There should be no impact since Scabbard only runs during compilation and generated images are not meant to be packaged into binary. You could control if Scabbard is enabled for release builds via `scabbard { enabled = false }` block.

## What is the impact on build time?

1. Scabbard processor uses standard annoatation processing APIs to generate images. This lets the processor be cacheable and does not run when inputs have not changed.

2. Currently there are no benchmark available and performmance was not a major focus for initial release and more work is expected to be done in this area.

3. Scabbard processor is a plugin to Dagger via Dagger SPI and it is non incremental. There are some ideas to improve this, please see #.

## How can I understand the generated graph?

Please refer to Scabbard cheat sheet.

## Will more formats (svg) be supported?

Yes, there are plans to support more formats. Please üëç this issue.

## Some dependencies are missing.

In order to keep graphs small and readable, Scabbard groups the dependencies by `@Component` or `@Subcomponent` and renders them in individual graphs.

This has the benefit of keeping the graphs readable for large projects but this structure might not properly render cross component dependencies (inherited bindings in a subcomponent). Some work is being doing in this area, please refer #.

## Any other format for visualizing the dependency graph?

Some other graph formats being considered are:

* **Component Tree**: Render component and subcomponents in a tree structure similar to [Uber Ribs.](https://1fykyq3mdn5r21tpna3wkdyi-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Carbon_architecture_Figure_02.gif)
* **Single graph**: Instead of splitting the graph into multiple files, render all nodes in single file.
